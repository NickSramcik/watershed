## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript

This website was built to be visually appealing on any device. It uses a CSS preprocessor (SASS) to make use of extra styling features. The layout is built via flexbox with media queries to make the website responsive to smaller devices. 

## Optimizations

Clicking on the images returns the user to the top of the page. This needs to be adjusted to either display a larger preview of the image, or remove the anchor tag on it entirely. The back end needs more development so that the contact form actually sends its data somewhere. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project showed me the power of presentation. FLOW is an organization I've been involved with for a long time, but I've never been very happy with the look of their website. I think this design and layout looks much more modernized and approachable.
